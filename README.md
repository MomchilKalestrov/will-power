next js app

to install dependencies:
`npm i`
to start dev server:
`npm run dev`
to start production:
`npm run build`
`npm run start`

to run properly add the `MONGODB_URI`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variables

why is it called willpower?
- because it's the same acronym as WordPress (WP)
- because recently it's been taking me quite a lot of willpower to go on with my days
